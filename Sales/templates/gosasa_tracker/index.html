<h1>Gosasa Tracking</h1>
<p> Designed to bring the latest fresh food market prices straight to your desktop. Our app tracks the prices of a variety of vegetables, gathering data from multiple sources to give you an accurate and up-to-date picture of the market. Once a day, the app compiles this information and sends it out to our subscribed users via email. This allows farmers, grocery store owners, and individual shoppers to stay informed and make informed decisions about their purchases </p>
